Install packages with `npm i` and start server with `npm start`.

Classes details are shown below:

Class A:

Clear and detailed sightings where the witness observes a creature resembling Bigfoot at a close range. These sightings often involve a clear view of the creature's physical features and behaviors.

Class B:
Indirect or ambiguous sightings, such as hearing strange vocalizations, finding footprints, or sensing the presence of Bigfoot without directly seeing the creature. These encounters may lack the visual confirmation characteristic of Class A sightings.

Class C:
Remote or distant sightings where the witness observes Bigfoot from a considerable distance. These sightings may involve the use of binoculars or telescopes but lack the proximity for detailed visual confirmation.

Class D:
Nocturnal or nighttime sightings of Bigfoot. These encounters occur during low-light conditions, often involving glowing eyes or the creature being illuminated by artificial light sources.

Class E:
Encounters involving multiple witnesses or groups of people who independently observe Bigfoot. Multiple witness sightings can add credibility to the report and contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the event.
